While Jupyter Notebooks themselves have been around for a long time and SAS has been supporting them for a number of years, it hasn't been possible to submit your SAS Global Forum paper as a Jupyter Notebook - until now!

We're really excited that, starting with SAS Global Forum 2021, those presenting at SAS Global Forum 2021 will have the ability to submit their paper as a Jupyter notebook. The notebook will be hosted as an asset in the SAS Global Forum Proceedings and hosted on Github as an interactive asset that people can engage with.

## Requirements

The requirements for using this template to create your SAS Global Forum paper can be found in much more detail on the SAS [`sas_kernel`](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas_kernel) Github page. If you are super confident, the TL;DR version is:

1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install Jupyter Notebook
3. Install the sas_kernel
4. (Optional) Install Jupyter Notebook extension `showSASLog` ([link](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas_kernel/tree/main/sas_kernel/nbextensions))
5. (Optional) Install Jupyter Notebook extension `sasTheme` ([link](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas_kernel/tree/main/sas_kernel/nbextensions))

## How does this template work?

This template works in just the same way that the Microsoft Word template, and any other template that you might have used, works. Just download it and, following the instructions regarding style contained with, write your paper!

## Todo

- [ ] Include some more detailed instructions about how to connect to SAS from the Notebook
- [ ] Include some more specific Jupyter instructions within the notebook
